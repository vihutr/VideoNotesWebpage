Have one half of the page with written analysis/notes with clickable timestamps while the other half has a youtube video of the match. Be able to switch left and right both of the halves. Dark and light theme.

Click on a "Create Analysis" Button
Creates analysis and lets you do the things above?

Achieve:
Halves of page: divs
how to switch halves? (code to switch div positions) potentially also do bottom and top
start with:
div containing a text box
div containing embedded video
harder to do?:
timestamps in text linking to video

At some point add:
- exporting or importing of these notes to be easily shareable.
- posting public or private version? would require some database
- would also require a login feature (branch on github before doing this?)
